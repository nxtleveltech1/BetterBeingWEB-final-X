We have one main colour that is used for
our Lock Up and Logo
Secondary colours get used in the
background, not as blocked out colours
but rather with the help of AI as
subconsciously used for items in the
background to make the foreground
main colour pop.
If we need to use our colours on a large
scale we would always lean towards
using Citron as it pops better large scale
Champagne gets used for stationary or
when needing a muted colour
Black Bean gets used as alt text colour

FONTS
HEADINGS

Headings are done in League Spartan (all caps) always with a 88 pnt letter spacing

copy or short subheadings
Copy gets written in Playfair Display - not all caps and 0 pnt letter spacing

MATERIALS
Clay perfectly illustrates how we take from
nature, put hands to it and create new
It also symbolises our connection to Earth
and grounded nature of the business

Paper provides a soft
yet natural feel to a
background. It plays into
the hand of ‘the creator’
to allow for free sketch

Stone, again repeating
the grounded nature of BB
but emphasises a strength,
the unwavering, unshakable
‘solid’ part to the businesses
core.

ICONOGRAPHY

‘nature’s price tag’
These Icons need to be explored
more once we look at practical
application, but this is a representation
of the style of Icons used

100% natural badge
for most products

ILLUSTRATION STYLE
‘The creator’ create’s
in a way that feels like a
hand was involved.
To express without giving
up our anonymity, ‘the creator’
becomes the embodiment of not
only us but our fellow creators
who’s products we bring in.
Like the paper clip on the original
Microsoft Windows this becomes our
user’s companion in their shopping experience
It’s line’s and therefore our illustration style
becomes thin and hand drawn instead of perfect

‘the creator’

PAT TERNS
‘finger print style ripple’
sound
resonance
frequency
growth
earth’s contours

‘grid type design’
structure
solid
contrasting to other pattern
modern

this is a visual
design pattern
not brought in
by a graphic but
rather in the way
graphics get laid
out in a design
to form this pattern

PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE
‘romantic, hyper realistic, warm’

Photo’s need to always feel warm
That also means that there is a slightly
darker aesthetic.
Background to have a slight ‘blur’ with
focus drawn to the centre, or action/product
part of the photo.
Always bring in a red tone, with optional pops
of our secondary colour in the background.
Always realistic.
Feeling of luxury due to the quality and
aesthetic of the photo’s.
They all have to share this visual language.
