# Project Brief: Enterprise E-commerce Features Implementation

## Executive Summary
We have successfully transformed BetterBeingWEB from a basic MVP to a professional, enterprise-ready e-commerce solution with a suite of enterprise features. This includes a complete navigation system, dynamic hero sections, multi-step checkout, order management backend, and database enhancements.
