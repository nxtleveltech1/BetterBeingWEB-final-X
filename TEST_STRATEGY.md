# BetterBeingWEB Comprehensive Test Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for BetterBeingWEB, covering all testing levels from unit to end-to-end testing, performance, accessibility, and visual regression testing.

## Testing Pyramid

### 1. Unit Testing (Vitest)
**Coverage Target**: 80%+
**Scope**: Components, hooks, utilities, services

**Priority Components**:
- AuthContext & CartContext
- All custom hooks (useAuth, usePerformanceMonitoring, etc.)
- API services and utilities
- Form validation and error handling
- Product normalization and data processing

### 2. Integration Testing (Vitest + Playwright)
**Scope**: Component interactions, API integrations, state management

**Key Integration Points**:
- Authentication flow integration
- Cart and checkout integration
- Product search and filtering
- Payment processing integration
- API service integrations

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
**Coverage**: Critical user journeys

**Key User Journeys**:
1. **Guest User Flow**: Browse → Search → View Product → Add to Cart → Checkout
2. **Registered User Flow**: Login → Personalization → Purchase → Order History
3. **Admin Flow**: Product Management → Order Management → User Management
4. **Authentication Flow**: Register → Login → Password Reset
5. **Checkout Flow**: Cart → Shipping → Payment → Confirmation

### 4. Visual Regression Testing (Playwright)
**Scope**: UI consistency across browsers and devices

**Test Areas**:
- Design system component rendering
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Cross-browser visual consistency
- Brand bible compliance verification

### 5. Performance Testing (Playwright + Lighthouse)
**Metrics**:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.5s

### 6. Accessibility Testing (Playwright + Axe)
**Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Test Areas**:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- ARIA labels and roles
- Form accessibility

## Test Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- **Local Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- **Code Coverage**: Integrated with Vitest coverage reports
- **Mock Services**: Mock API responses for isolated testing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Pre-commit**: Unit tests and linting
- **Pull Request**: Full test suite + visual regression
- **Production Deployment**: Performance and accessibility audits

### Test Data Management
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data for products, users, orders
- **Factories**: Test data generation utilities
- **Seeding**: Database seeding for integration tests

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Setup Test Infrastructure**
   - Configure Vitest for frontend and backend
   - Set up Playwright projects and configurations
   - Create test utilities and helpers

2. **Unit Test Coverage**
   - Core utilities and services (100% coverage)
   - Context providers and hooks
   - API service layer

### Phase 2: Component Testing (Week 3-4)
1. **Component Unit Tests**
   - All presentational components
   - Form components with validation
   - Interactive components (search, filters, cart)

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component composition testing
   - State management integration
   - API integration testing

### Phase 3: E2E Testing (Week 5-6)
1. **Critical User Journeys**
   - Authentication flows
   - Product browsing and search
   - Cart and checkout process

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
   - Mobile and tablet responsiveness

### Phase 4: Specialized Testing (Week 7-8)
1. **Visual Regression**
   - Design system component testing
   - Responsive design verification

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Lighthouse audits
   - Load testing for critical paths

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Automated accessibility scans
   - Manual accessibility verification

## Test Automation Strategy

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    steps:
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test:unit
      
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: npm test:integration
      
      - name: Run E2E Tests
        run: npm test:e2e
      
      - name: Run Visual Regression
        run: npm test:visual
      
      - name: Performance Audit
        run: npm run perf:audit
```

### Test Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Playwright and Vitest HTML outputs
- **JUnit XML**: CI integration compatible reports
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage metrics and trends
- **Performance Metrics**: Historical performance data

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- Test coverage >= 80%
- No critical bugs in main branch
